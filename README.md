# Implementation-of-Linear-and-Polynomial-Regression-Models-for-Predicting-Car-Prices

## AIM:
To write a program to predict car prices using Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression models.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. Data Collection:

. Import essential libraries like pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, and seaborn.
Load the dataset using pandas.read_csv().
Data Preprocessing:

Address any missing values in the dataset.
Select key features for training the models.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets with train_test_split().
Linear Regression:

Initialize the Linear Regression model from sklearn.
Train the model on the training data using .fit().
Make predictions on the test data using .predict().
Evaluate model performance with metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and the R² score.
Polynomial Regression:

Use PolynomialFeatures from sklearn to create polynomial features.
Fit a Linear Regression model to the transformed polynomial features.
Make predictions and evaluate performance similar to the linear regression model.
Visualization:

Plot the regression lines for both Linear and Polynomial models.
Visualize residuals to assess model performance.
